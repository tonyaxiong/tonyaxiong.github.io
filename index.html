		<h2>Welcome! It's nice to meet you.</h2>
		<p>
			My name is Tonya and I am currently attending Saint Paul College pursuing a Visualization Technologies AAS degree. I’ve taken classes in graphical web design, HTML, CSS, Photoshop, and Illustrator. I have a passion for learning and in this industry we have to constantly keep up to date with new software and technologies.
			<br><br>
			I was born and raised in Saint Paul, Minnesota. Halloween and Christmas are my two favorite holidays. I love being outdoors during the spring and summer months and I find a lot of comfort in nature. In my free time I like to play video games and draw. I have a large family - so I know how to handle a group of people - and I love being a part of a team. All through middle and high school I’ve played sports and joined multiple clubs. I’ve learned a lot about working with different types of people and being an integral part of a larger vision.
			<br><br>
			I am a very organized, positive and motivated person. I love organizing and putting everything in its place. I’m also a very positive thinker. I don’t ever let a bad situation put me down for long. Lastly, I’m a self-motivated worker. I know what I have to do and I do it. I get so sucked into my work sometimes I don’t notice the entire day that just went by.
